# Calculus Code

This code was written for Ted's Calculus class 2017-2018 at The Nueva School. If you're reading this, though, you're probably looking for the rocket launch simulation. Those files are rockets.py, rockets2.py, and rockets3.py only. The rest are for other projects.

## Getting Started

This Readme is for the rocket launch simulation. Other files are not meant to be run by others.
The final rocket launch simulation file is rockets3.py. The other rocket files are not guaranteed to work.

### Dependencies

Python 3
Matplotlib

### Installation and Use

Download the repository and open Terminal. Type cd and drag and drop the folder onto the Terminal window. You should see something like

```
cd /Users/(youruser)/(folder)/calculus-master 
```
From there, run

```
python3 rockets3.py
```

On startup, the program should print

```
Testing? y/n
```
To fully run the program, input n. Inputting y will bypass the special print function.
After your input, the program should print

```
Test inactive
```
and then print a large block of text instructions. Follow the code instructions to run the simulation. To finish the program, close the three graphs. The program should terminate itself.
